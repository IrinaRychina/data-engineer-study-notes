I use this project to track my progress in learning data-engineering.

I come up with questions after I read any topic or ask ChatGpt to generate them for me.
The questions are stored in files organised by topic.

Over time I revisit them and answer them again.
This applies the principles of __active recall__ and __spaced repetition__ for effective learning.
